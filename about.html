                        Void Interactive is an independent game development studio based in Australia. 
                        The studio was founded in 2012 by AJ "Black" Johannesen, 
                        who serves as the CEO and Creative Director. Void Interactive is primarily 
                        known for their work on the game Ready or Not, a highly realistic and immersive 
                        tactical shooter. The team at Void Interactive consists 
                        of passionate developers with expertise in various areas of game development,
                         including programming, level design, animation, and sound design. 
                         They strive to create realistic and authentic gaming experiences, often 
                         collaborating with professionals from law enforcement and armed forces 
                         to ensure accuracy and attention to detail in their games.
                        Though Ready or Not is the studio's flagship title, Void Interactive
                         has also developed other projects and prototypes in the past, showcasing their 
                         versatility and commitment to innovation in the gaming industry.
